Upload aggregated human case / dead end host surveillance data from a spreadsheet.

## How to save data from a spreadsheet

Use the "Choose file" button to select your .xlsx or .csv spreadsheet. Click "Upload" to bring that data into a table in your web browser. You should now see the contents of your spreadsheet, along with any data validation errors. If any existing records are found that match the data in your spreadsheet, you will see the ID of that row's matching database record in the "Record to Update" column. You may remove a row from your spreadsheet data by clicking the red trashbin icon to the right of each row. This will remove the row from the data to be sent to the database, but will not delete any information from the database.

Once any validation errors have been fixed, you can click the "Save to Database" button at the bottom of the table to send the data to the database. You will be shown a confirmation modal summarizing the number of database records to be updated and the number to be created. Click "Ok" at this point to confirm your action.

If all the data is sent successfully, you will temporarily see a green box with a success message. Any rows that are not successfully saved to the database will remain in the web browser table view.

Database records may be viewed at the [manage records page](https://gateway.vectorsurv.org/v5/case-count/manage) - [docs](https://docs.vectorsurv.org/v5/case-count/manage).

## Spreadsheet Format

The spreadsheet must match the formatting of [the template spreadsheet](https://ucdavis.box.com/s/bu8rjxmpiip6yspclmehy9noeifrf878)

## Data Validation

- Fields with set accepted values must match one of the values shown in the table above. For example, the Date Type column cell of each row can only be either "Report Date" or "Onset Date / Asymptomatic Test". If your spreadsheet contains a typo, you will be able to select your intended choice after the spreadsheet has been uploaded to the web browser and before the data has been saved to the database.

- Each agency can have only one record per combination of reporting group, disease year, aggregation time frame, disease aggregation time frame value, pathogen, disease host, date type, and classification. If that combination already exists in the database, the id of that existing record will be shown in the table and the spreadsheet data's case count values will overwrite the values already in the database.

## Updating Data

The spreadsheet upload tool only adds and updates data; it can't delete database data. This means that if you first upload a spreadsheet with 10 rows, modify it, and then upload it later with only 8 rows, you will still have a total of 10 rows of data in the database.

## FAQ

### _How do I update Probable or Suspect data to Confirmed status?_

If you want to use your spreadsheet to change case count values for a certain group/year/time frame/pathogen/host/date type from one classification to another, you will need to represent both combinations in your spreadsheet. Apply the total case count, symptomatic case count, asymptomatic case count, neuroinvasive case count, and death / euthanized animal case count values to the correct row (in this example, the one with the status value "Confirmed"), and replace the other row's counts with 0.
