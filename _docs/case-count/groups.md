![Reporting Groups Page](/assets/images/docs/case-count-groups.png)

A reporting group record is a combination of the group name, the counties that are a part of that group, and the year.

The group name must be unique for its year.

A county can only be in one reporting group per year.

A reporting group record must have at least one county.
