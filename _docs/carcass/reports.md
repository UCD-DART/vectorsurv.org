If your agency conducts a dead bird testing program, you can enter reported birds here.

## Fields

* **Report Date**: The date the bird was called in. Date format is based on the settings under [Account Preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/settings/account-preferences).
* **Caller Name, Phone #, Alternate Phone #, Email**: Use these fields to identify the individual making the report and his/her contact information (optional).
* **Address, City, Postal Code**: The address of the site where the bird was found. This can be geocoded so the location appears on the map and coordinates are attached to the report.
* **Surroundings**: Describe the environment in which the dead bird was found. Only one selection can be made in this field.
* **# of Carcasses**: How many dead birds were reported at this site? This number will generally be 1.
* **Carcasses**: Description of the dead bird. If more than one carcass was reported, there will be one box per bird.
  * **Species**: Choose the species (if identifiable) from a number of common birds. If more than one carcass of the same species was reported, you can copy the value to all other carcasses by clicking on the icon to the right.
