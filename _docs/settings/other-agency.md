Request access to view another agency's data.

Your current agency(ies) will be shown under the **Agency Access Accounts** table. It displays information on your login type, whether your access is active, and if it is your primary agency. You can change your primary agency on the [security details]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/settings/security) page.

You can request access to another agency by clicking on **New Agency Access** and using the dropdown menu to select the agency you wish to access. You can also choose your login type between _User_ and _View-only_. That agency's manager will review your request.
