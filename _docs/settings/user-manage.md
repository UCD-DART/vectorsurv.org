Manage active users of this agency.

You can view all current **Active Users** and their login types on the main table. You can edit any user's details by clicking the _edit_ link or remove a user from the agency by clicking the _deactivate_ link.

You can add a new user for your agency by clicking on **Add New User** at the top of the page. You are required to specify a _Username_, _Password_, and _Email_ for the new user, which can all be modified later by changing [security details]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/settings/security) in [My Account]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/settings/account). It is also recommended that you confirm the correct _Login Type_ with the dropdown menu (User is the default and will likely be appropriate for most users) and give the new user's name.
