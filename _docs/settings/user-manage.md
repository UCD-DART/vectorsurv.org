Manage active users of this agency.

You can view all current **Active Users** and their login types on the main table. You can edit any user's details by clicking the *edit* link or remove a user from the agency by clicking the *deactivate* link.

You can add a new user for your agency by clicking on **Add New User** at the top of the page. You are required to specify a *Username*, *Password*, and *Email* for the new user, which can all be modified later by changing [security details]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/settings/security) in [My Account]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/settings/account). It is also recommended that you confirm the correct *Login Type* with the dropdown menu (User is the default and will likely be appropriate for most users) and give the new user's name.
