Add and manage tokens that are used to access Gateway data in other applications.

Currently active tokens for your agency will be listed under **Active Tokens**. You can manually expire a token before its expiration date by clicking on the _expire_ link under the **Actions** column.

Create a new token by clicking on **New Token** at the top of the page. Clicking the button will generate a new unique token that can be used in external applications and will automatically update the **Active Tokens** table below.
