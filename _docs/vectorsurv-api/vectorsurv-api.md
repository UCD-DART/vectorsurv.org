# Integrate with VectorSurv!
The VectorSurv API allows you to connect to the VectorSurv system, providing a way to interact with your VectorSurv data outside of the [VectorSurv gateway](https://gateway.vectorsurv.org/). Here are some of the ways you can use the VectorSurv API.

## Analyze your data in R using vectorsurvR

The [vectorsurvR package](/docs/vectorsurv-api/vectorsurvr/) is an easy way to perform analysis and create custom visualizations using your VectorSurv data. You don't need to be a programmer. VectorSurvR provides easy-to-use functions to pull exactly the data you need from the API, and makes it available as a starting point for calculations and visualizations.

No experience with R? That's ok. Check out our [R video series: Decision making and reporting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BfMG0P6Ndc&list=PLbSUoxtSzuqQFhsquussQDNJdwt2-k1bh), created to help you get started.

## Connect to BI software

Connect popular Business Intelligence tools such as Power BI or Tableau to visualize and analyze your data. Connect your data tools to your real time vector data using the RESTful VectorSurv API to use it independently or alongside your other data for evidenced-based decision support.

## Build your own software tools
The VectorSurv API is a RESTful API, making it useful for creating your own software tools to interact with your data in the VectorSurv system. Visit the [VectorSurv API documentation](https://docs.api.vectorsurv.org) to read about the API specifications and see some helpful examples.
