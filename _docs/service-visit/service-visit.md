A Service Visit is a record of any work your agency has done in the field. You can record where you went and what you did while you were there. Any collections, inspections, or pesticide applications can be entered explicitly.

## Service Visit Form

**Fields**

- **Name**: An easily memorable moniker for the Service Visit record, such as an address. It does not need to be unique.

- **Responder**: The person who performed the Service Visit.

- **Flag**: Check this box to flag the record for future interest. Record any details in the Flag Description field.

- **Flag Description**: Available only when Flag is checked. Record any details regarding the reason to flag here. The Flag Description will appear when mousing over the flag icon on other pages. Saving the Service Visit with the Flag unchecked will remove any existing Flag Description.

- **Start Time**: The time the Service Visit started. You can type specific times or use the dropdown select to pick times by 15 minute increments.

- **End Time**: The time the Service Visit ended. You can type specific times or use the dropdown select to pick times by 15 minute increments.

- **Latitude and Longitude**: The location of the Service Visit. Coordinates can be entered manually. The fields can also be automatically populated by either expanding the map and clicking on the desired location or by typing an address in the GeoCode field in the upper right (i.e., the magnifying glass). Note: clicking on the "Recenter Map" icon in the lower right corner will cause the map to pan back to the current Service Visit location.
