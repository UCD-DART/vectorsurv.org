View and edit saved pool test results.

Select the month and year for which you wish to view [results]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/test-results) by choosing the appropriate values using the drop-down arrows. Click the **Change Month/Year** button to make the change.

You can view the results either by **[Pool #]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/pool)** or by **[Submission #]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/submission)**. Either table can be minimized and/or maximized by clicking on the respective title next to the arrow.

### By Pool

This table shows all test results by [Pool ID]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/pool) for the selected time frame. It displays information about the pool, including **Collection Date**, **Trap Type**, **Species**, **Sex**, and **# in Pool**. Clicking the checkbox under the **Include?** column allows that pool's test results to be viewed along with other checked pools. The **Positive?** column shows whether that particular pool tested positive and to which pathogen. Clicking the _View_ link under the **Actions** column takes you to the details for that pool's [results]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/test-results) if results for that pool have been submitted. Here, you can _edit_ or _delete_ that result. Editing will pull up a pop-up box with the same fields as the [new test result]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/test-results) page, which you can then save. Do this if you need to change the **Status** of the test result from Pending to Positive or Negative, for example.

### By Submission

This table shows all test results by [Submission ID]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/submission) for the selected time frame. It gives information on how many pools were in the submission and how many of those pools tested positive for any pathogen. Clicking the **Submission #** gives a print-friendly version of that submission's form, similarly to the [submission management]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/submission-manage) table. Clicking the _View_ link under the **Actions** column takes to to the details for every pool's test results for that submission, which you can then _edit_ and _delete_ as before.

There are summary boxes on the right-hand side of the screen describing the tests for the current month by species and by arbovirus results.
