Manage mosquito pools that have been submitted for arbovirus testing.

Select the month and year for which you wish to view [submissions]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/submission) by choosing the appropriate values using the drop-down arrows. Click the **Change Month/Year** button to make the change.

All pool submissions that were added during the selected time frame will be displayed on the table. Checking the box under the **Label?** column allows you to click the **Create Labels** button below the table. This performs the same function as clicking the *labels* link under the **Actions** column.

Clicking on a **Submission #** performs the same action as the *print* link under the **Actions** column, which is to pull up a printer-friendly version of the submission form. You also have the option to *edit* the submission, which pulls up a filled-in [new submission]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/submission) page where pools that are part of the submission are initially checked while pools that are available for addition are unchecked, or to *delete* the submission.
